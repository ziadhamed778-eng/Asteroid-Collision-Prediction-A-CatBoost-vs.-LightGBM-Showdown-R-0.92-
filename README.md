# Asteroid-Collision-Prediction-A-CatBoost-vs.-LightGBM-Showdown-R-0.92-
CatBoost achieved an impressive R² = 0.9215 in predicting asteroid collision risk using Near-Earth Object data. It outperformed LightGBM by over 10%, thanks to its native handling of categorical features and efficient early stopping. The project shows CatBoost’s strength in accurate, high-performance orbital risk modeling
